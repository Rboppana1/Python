Instructions
Make a rock, paper, scissors game.
Start the game by asking the player:
"What do you choose? Type 0 for Rock, 1 for Paper or 2 for Scissors."
From there you will need to figure out:
How you will store the user's input.
How you will generate a random choice for the computer.
How you will compare the user's and the computer's choice to determine the winner (or a draw).
And also how you will give feedback to the player.
You can find the "official" rules of the game on the World Rock Paper Scissors Association website.
